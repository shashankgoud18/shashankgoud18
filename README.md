# 👋 Hey there, I'm GANGAPURAM SHASHANK GOUD

I’m a passionate **Full Stack Developer**, **AI-driven web application builder**, and **Voice Automation enthusiast** from India.  
Currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science at **Maharishi Markandeshwar Deemed to Be University**, I’m focused on creating impactful tools — like AI-powered resume analyzers and voice assistants.  
If it solves a real problem, I’m probably already prototyping it.

# 💫 About Me:

🔭 I’m currently working on cutting-edge real-world projects like **MatchMySkill** and a **Virtual-Assistant** — turning ideas into actual, usable AI-powered products that help users optimize resumes and automate daily tasks through voice.  

👯 I’m excited to collaborate on projects involving full-stack development, AI integrations, voice tech, and productivity tools. I value learning and solving challenging problems over simply adding repositories.  

🤝 I’m looking for help with advanced topics like **AI API integration (Google Gemini, OpenAI)**, **real-time speech recognition**, and **scaling MVPs for practical users**. I am open about where I get stuck and eager to grow.  

🌱 I’m currently deep-diving into **Data Structures & Algorithms**, **Machine Learning**, **backend systems**, and improving my skills with modern web stacks as I prepare for software internships.  

💬 Feel free to ask me about building projects from scratch — from initial architecture to deployment. Also happy to share tips on managing internship prep and balancing multiple projects.  

⚡ Fun fact: I contribute actively to open source as part of GirlScript Summer of Code and believe in learning through real, user-focused development.
